- Complete Blood Count (CBC): Annually or as needed
- Lipid Panel: Annually
- A1C: Every 3 months (diabetes, uncontrolled), every 6 months (controlled)

**Disease-Specific**:

## Medication Patterns

### Polypharmacy (Multiple Conditions)

Realistic patients with 3+ chronic conditions may have:
- 5-12 daily medications
- 2-4 PRN (as needed) medications
- Multiple times per day dosing

**Example (Diabetes + Hypertension + CAD + Hyperlipidemia)**:
1. Metformin 1000mg BID
2. Lisinopril 20mg daily
3. Atorvastatin 40mg daily
4. Aspirin 81mg daily
5. Metoprolol 50mg BID
6. Amlodipine 10mg daily

### Medication Adherence Patterns

**Realistic Patterns**:
- 70-80% adherence common
- Missed doses increase over time
- Non-adherence contributes to poor control
- Simplified regimens improve adherence

## Disease Progression Timelines

### Type 2 Diabetes
- **Year 0**: Diagnosis, metformin
- **Year 1-2**: May need second agent
- **Year 3-5**: Possible insulin, early complications
- **Year 5-10**: Nephropathy, neuropathy, retinopathy screening abnormalities
- **Year 10+**: Advanced complications, multiple medications

### Hypertension
- **Year 0**: Diagnosis, single agent
- **Year 1-3**: May need second agent
- **Year 5-10**: Usually stable on 1-2 medications
- **Year 10+**: Possible end-organ damage (LVH, CKD)

### COPD
- **Year 0**: Diagnosis, FEV1 60-80%
- **Year 2-5**: FEV1 decline to 40-60%, increased exacerbations
- **Year 5-10**: FEV1 <40% (severe), oxygen therapy needed
- **Year 10+**: Very severe, frequent hospitalizations

Use these patterns as guides, adjusting based on patient characteristics and specified timespan.
